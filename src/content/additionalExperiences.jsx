                        As the Director of Technology at 1-2-3 Go Driving Academy, I am instrumental in enhancing the
                        organization's technological infrastructure and online presence. I designed and built the
                        website and enterprise tech stack, which resulted in an impressive 87% decrease in
                        time-to-enrollment. Leveraging SEO, organic, and paid social strategies, I drove a 318% increase
                        in website and applicant portal traffic. I implemented and enforce a robust security protocol
                        for student and staff data, ensuring compliance with industry standards and achieving 100%
                        secure handling of sensitive information. My leadership in branding efforts significantly
                        boosted brand recognition and market presence, resulting in over 3,000 site visits per month.
                        Through strategic branding, website development, email campaigns, and the creation of an
                        applicant portal, I optimized the enrollment process and contributed to the academy's overall
                        success.
