                   With a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from Baylor University, I've journeyed through the
                   exciting landscapes of software development, product management, and data-driven decision-making. I
                   thrive at the intersection of technology, entrepreneurship, and human connection, where innovation
                   meets collaboration. My passion lies in crafting solutions that address technical challenges and
                   resonate with users on a personal level. <br/> <br/>

                   In my career, I've worn many hatsâ€”whether diving
                   deep into code, strategizing product roadmaps, or engaging with stakeholders, I've learned to
                   navigate both technical and business realms seamlessly. I believe the best products emerge when the
                   voice of the customer is at the heart of every decision. This customer-centric approach has been my
                   guiding principle, driving me to seek insights and feedback to inform my work. <br/> <br/>

                   I'm an advocate of thorough research and analytical approaches, leveraging these tools to make
                   informed decisions and propel projects forward. My goal is always to create offerings that not only
                   meet market needs but also exceed expectations. Building strong connections and fostering
                   collaboration are my secret weapons in driving successful outcomes. Let's connect and explore how I
                   can contribute to your organization. <br/> <br/>
