                   With my education, internships, and professional work, I have amassed a vast understanding of the
                   key principles of lifecycle management in SaaS solutions. I intend for these and future experiences
                   to propel me further into my budding tech career. I love forming new connections on personal and
                   professional levels, reach out and let's build something together.
