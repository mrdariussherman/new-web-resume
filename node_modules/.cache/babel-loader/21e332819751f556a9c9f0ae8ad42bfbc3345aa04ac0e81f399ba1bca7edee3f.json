Following\n                        this, I transitioned to working with Swift and Objective-C to bring new functionality to\n                        existing iOS apps.\n                    </div>\n                    <hr/>\n                    <div className=\"col\">\n                        <b>Research Institute</b> @ <b>Baylor Scott & White Health</b> <br/>\n                        software engineer intern<br/>\n                        <small>may 2017 - august 2017</small> <br/>\n\n                        As a Simulation Software Intern, I was primarily in charge of developing simulation\n                        software for the HTC Vive and Oculus Rift virtual reality devices. This software would\n                        render bone models to the device and given the axis information from the controller could\n                        render a cutting plane to allow doctors to analyze the fit of ball-and-socket joints. In\n                        addition to integrating this technology into the medical field, I also facilitated a study\n                        that would help bring virtual reality into training the next generation of surgeons.\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n        );\n    }\n}"],"mappings":";AAAA,OAAOA,KAAK,MAAM,OAAO;AAAA,SAAAC,MAAA,IAAAC,OAAA;AAEzB,OAAO,MAAMC,UAAU,SAASH,KAAK,CAACI,SAAS,CAAC;EAC5CC,MAAMA,CAAA,EAAG;IACL,oBACIH,OAAA;MAAKI,SAAS,EAAC,8BAA8B;MAAAC,QAAA,gBACzCL,OAAA;QAAKI,SAAS,EAAC,0BAA0B;QAAAC,QAAA,EAAC;MAAU;QAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAK,CAAC,eAC1DT,OAAA;QAAKI,SAAS,EAAC,sBAAsB;QAAAC,QAAA,gBACjCL,OAAA;UAAAK,QAAA,gBACIL,OAAA;YAAAK,QAAA,EAAG;UAAG;YAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,OAAG,CAAC,KAAC,eAAAT,OAAA;YAAAM,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,OAAI,CAAC,wBACI,eAAAT,OAAA;YAAAM,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eACzBT,OAAA;YAAAK,QAAA,EAAO;UAAwB;YAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,OAAO,CAAC,KAAC,eAAAT,OAAA;YAAAM,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,OAAI,CAAC,+gBAOjD;QAAA;UAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OAAK,CAAC,eACNT,OAAA;UAAAM,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eACLT,OAAA;UAAAK,QAAA,gBACIL,OAAA;YAAAK,QAAA,EAAG;UAAG;YAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,OAAG,CAAC,KAAC,eAAAT,OAAA;YAAAM,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,OAAI,CAAC,8BACU,eAAAT,OAAA;YAAAM,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eAC/BT,OAAA;YAAAK,QAAA,EAAO;UAAuB;YAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,OAAO,CAAC,KAAC,eAAAT,OAAA;YAAAM,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,OAAI,CAAC,4pBAShD;QAAA;UAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OAAK,CAAC,eACNT,OAAA;UAAAM,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eACLT,OAAA;UAAAK,QAAA,gBACIL,OAAA;YAAAK,QAAA,EAAG;UAA0B;YAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,OAAG,CAAC,KAAC,eAAAT,OAAA;YAAAM,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,OAAI,CAAC,sBACrB,eAAAT,OAAA;YAAAM,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eACvBT,OAAA;YAAAK,QAAA,EAAO;UAAsB;YAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,OAAO,CAAC,KAAC,eAAAT,OAAA;YAAAM,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,OAAI,CAAC,0tBAS/C;QAAA;UAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OAAK,CAAC,eACNT,OAAA;UAAAM,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eACLT,OAAA;UAAAK,QAAA,gBACIL,OAAA;YAAAK,QAAA,EAAG;UAAK;YAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,OAAG,CAAC,KAAC,eAAAT,OAAA;YAAAM,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,OAAI,CAAC,sBACA,eAAAT,OAAA;YAAAM,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eACvBT,OAAA;YAAAK,QAAA,EAAO;UAAkB;YAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,OAAO,CAAC,KAAC,eAAAT,OAAA;YAAAM,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,OAAI,CAAC,8XAM3C;QAAA;UAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OAAK,CAAC,eACNT,OAAA;UAAAM,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eACLT,OAAA;UAAKI,SAAS,EAAC,KAAK;UAAAC,QAAA,gBAChBL,OAAA;YAAAK,QAAA,EAAG;UAAkB;YAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,OAAG,CAAC,OAAG,eAAAT,OAAA;YAAAK,QAAA,EAAG;UAA2B;YAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,OAAG,CAAC,KAAC,eAAAT,OAAA;YAAAM,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,OAAI,CAAC,4BAC5C,eAAAT,OAAA;YAAAM,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eAC7BT,OAAA;YAAAK,QAAA,EAAO;UAAsB;YAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,OAAO,CAAC,KAAC,eAAAT,OAAA;YAAAM,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,OAAI,CAAC,ihBAQ/C;QAAA;UAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OAAK,CAAC;MAAA;QAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OACL,CAAC;IAAA;MAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OACL,CAAC;EAEd;AACJ","ignoreList":[]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module","externalDependencies":[]}
